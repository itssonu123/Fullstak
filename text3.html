        <p>Early life and background</p>
      </h2>
      <h4>
        Dhoni was born in Ranchi, Bihar (now in Jharkhand) and hails from a
        Hindu Rajput family with roots in Uttarakhand.[11][12] He is the
        youngest of three children of Pan Singh and Devaki Devi.[13][14][15][16]
        His paternal village Lwali, is in Jainti Tehsil, Lamgara block of the
        Almora District of Uttarakhand. [17] His parents moved from Uttarakhand
        to Ranchi, Jharkhand where his father worked as a pump operator in
        junior management position in MECON Colony situated in Doranda area in
        Ranchi.[18] Unlike Dhoni, his uncle and cousins spell their surname as
        Dhauni.[17][needs copy edit] Previously Dhoni was the goalkeeper for his
        DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir school's football team,[19] but after seeing
        his goalkeeping skills, coach Keshav Ranjan Banerjee, one who inspired
        Dhoni to be a cricketer, picked him to play cricket for his school
        team.[20] His exceptional wicketkeeping skills allowed him to become the
        regular wicketkeeper at the Commando Cricket Club (1995â€“1998). Based on
        his performance at club cricket, he was picked for the 1997/98 season
        Vinoo Mankad Trophy Under-16 Championship, where he performed well.[16]
        From 2001 to 2003, Dhoni worked as a Travelling Ticket Examiner (TTE) at
        Kharagpur railway station under South Eastern Railway in Midnapore (W),
        a district in West Bengal.[21][22]
